# Simple Server IP and Port Grabber (C++)

Hi! I made a simple tool in C++ that grabs the server IP and port from FiveM by reading the process memory.

I used ChatGPT to add comments to the code so it’s easy for anyone to understand how it works. The tool reads the game’s memory to find the server IP and port.

To find the right offsets, I used Cheat Engine to get the offsets.

Feel free to check out the code and use it however you like!
